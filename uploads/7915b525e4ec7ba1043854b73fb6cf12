#00:00:07#,Lea,Hey Langston
#00:00:10#,James,Hey.
#00:00:12#,Lea,"You want to take like, five minutes to look at the data first and then, like, come together and, like, talk about it. Or."
#00:00:22#,James,Okay.
#00:00:22#,Oscar,Quick.
#00:00:27#,Lea,"I don't know what he just said, oh."
#00:00:34#,Oscar,A sca-
#00:00:34#,Lea,Can you hear him? Like I can hear him. I can't hear what he's saying. Okay.
#00:00:38#,James,Yeah.
#00:00:38#,Oscar,It's easier to see the trend box plots won't show the relationship between variables.
#00:00:46#,Lea,Okay. Oscar.
#00:00:51#,James,What are we doing? Okay. Um.
#00:01:12#,Lea,"In case you do choose to do the same one, um, I'm doing, um, the pandemic one about pandemics in history. And I'm still reading, but yeah."
#00:01:26#,James,What?
#00:01:29#,Lea,"I said, the one I'm doing is the pandemics one, so we don't do the same thing."
#00:01:34#,Oscar,Scatterplot could show how cases change over time. Box plot good for comparing months maybe.
#00:01:45#,James,Let's do.
#00:03:14#,Lea,"My computer is going really slow. Like I can't even see, um, like, my screen is white right now."
#00:03:22#,James,That's not good.
#00:03:23#,Lea,"If you finish before me, just let me know and I'll just listen to your stuff."
#00:03:30#,Oscar,Haha.
#00:03:30#,James,Are we looking at the same thing though? Because I don't see anything about a.
#00:03:35#,Oscar,Data doesn't drip away like a double scoop.
#00:03:36#,Lea,What I we're not supposed to be doing the same one. I was just telling you the one I was doing.
#00:03:41#,James,"No, I mean, are we on the same like page."
#00:03:45#,Lea,"Our world and data.org? I just type that into the browser, and it was one of the ones that came up."
#00:03:52#,James,Okay.
#00:03:57#,Lea,Let's try this one more time. Okay.
#00:06:21#,Lea,"Okay, I think I could talk about mine. Um, let me see the questions. Okay. To make sure. Um, okay. So the data set that I chose, um, like I said, talks about pandemics like over the years, um, and it uses circles to represent the death toll because, like, they're looking specifically at the number of people who died for each of these pandemics. And it starts from the Black Death and it goes to Covid 19. Um, one thing I will say, um, is that they already they mentioned that they don't they have they don't have exact numbers for certain pandemics, like, um, the Cholera. Yeah. That's how you pronounce it. Um, pandemic. Um, they don't have an exact death toll, so they just put like, little triangles on, like on, on a number line. But for one of them, it says like, at least 23 million of them died. And then like, one of the circles, um, for the Black Death talks about 50 million people dying. So the circle is pretty big. But then like the circle for that, the one that they said at least 23 million, they don't have a circle because they said it's unknown."
#00:07:30#,Lea,"But if you know, at least 23 million people died, then it comes off like it kind of misleads. It comes off misleading only because, like, that's half of the amount of people that died in the Black Death. But you can't really see the number of people that die, like, without reading it, you know, like it seems like less, um, relevant. And I think that they don't have, um, enough estimates for the ones that they don't know how many people died in because, like, they make it seem those look like really small pandemics where nobody died. But that, again, might that's definitely not the case. And I think that kind of shows in the later data that they have, because even when they show, um, like 2 million people died, the circles are still really, really small. So, I don't know, I feel like the circle should be a little bit bigger because so many people have died. It doesn't really emphasize like the magnitude of it. So I could I consider that misleading."
#00:08:41#,James,Okay. Um. For mine.
#00:08:48#,Oscar,"Yeah, visuals can be super misleading. Size should match the stats, or it's kind of like lying with pictures."
#00:08:57#,Lea,Exactly.
#00:08:59#,James,"Right on Oscar. So, uh, what I had was the distribution of population between different poverty thresholds. Um, and so it's like. It's like, um. They have like. The percentage of the population on one side. And then they have like the income. On the other side. And so I looked at, uh, Eastern Europe. And so it was like. Oh, and it goes from 1820 to 2018. So that's already one thing like it's not up to date. Um. But like. As you proceed through the."
#00:09:58#,Oscar,2018 data trying to talk 2023 stuff. That's like using floppy disks for homework.
#00:10:04#,James,"Yep. And, uh. Like as it continues. Uh, like it starts to. So it goes like they use colors to represent, uh, the income, like on the chart. So like, it goes red for below $1.90 a day, orange for a dollar 90 to $5, uh, yellow for 5 to $10, light blue for 10 to $30, and then dark blue to above 30. So like the red starts out like in 1820, it takes up most of it, the 70% and 1820. Well. 90% in 1820. And then."
#00:10:57#,Oscar,"So in 1820. Most folks were in the red zone like everyone was almost broke, according to today's dollar."
#00:11:05#,James,"Yep. Um. And then. Like as we reach the 2000s, the I think it's the blue. I think light blue takes the most. So like 10 to $30. So it shows that like their poverty rates got lower. Um. Do I think it's misleading? No."
#00:11:42#,Lea,Wait I have a question. So do they do this like on a map like you? Was it specifically in the US?
#00:11:48#,James,"Uh, so they have different areas. I don't think they put the US. I couldn't find the US, but they have different regions. They have East Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa. And like all those."
#00:12:03#,Lea,"So like the trend is like, um, as time progressed, people got higher incomes."
#00:12:11#,James,Yeah. But that's only for that's only for Eastern Europe.
#00:12:15#,Lea,"Yeah. Like only. Oh, only for Eastern Europe."
#00:12:18#,James,Yeah.
#00:12:19#,Lea,"Oh, okay. And then like the rest of them shows like a lower poverty rate or like a higher poverty rate. Sorry."
#00:12:29#,James,"Okay. Well. Well,"
#00:12:32#,Oscar,"Colors changed over the years, meaning people earned more. Cool."
#00:12:35#,James,I looked at the world.
#00:12:36#,Oscar,Focusing on one region can make it look too simple.
#00:12:40#,James,"Yeah, well, he said so. Like. It's different because like at the world, like if you're looking at the world. The majority of people are in the orange zone, which is $1.90 to $5. But like if you look specifically at Eastern Europe, it's, you know."
#00:12:58#,Lea,I consider that.
#00:12:58#,James,So if you looked at Africa.
#00:13:02#,Lea,"Oh, sorry."
#00:13:03#,James,No. Go ahead.
#00:13:04#,Lea,"I would say I just think that is a little misleading because to me, like, I think it's very representative of what we classify as like a first world and a third world country. And like they probably have the information there somewhere. But I think it's important to note, like why the poverty gap would be that large, like if you think of like imperialism and colonialization. So like, I think that there's a lot of outside factors that would have contributed to them having more."
#00:13:37#,Oscar,Yeah. Focusing on why parts of Africa are still in the orange zone would tell a much bigger story.
#00:13:43#,Lea,Exactly.
#00:13:45#,Lea,Oscar gets it. Okay. He's been so responsive.
#00:13:50#,James,"Yeah. And it's clear, like when we like."
#00:13:53#,Lea,Yeah. And more relevant.
#00:13:55#,James,Yeah.
#00:13:57#,Lea,"Okay, we're gonna go back to the main session since it's over."
